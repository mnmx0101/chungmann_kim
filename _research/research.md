### **From Food Crisis to Resource Allocation: Tracking Humanitarian Aid in Afghanistan**  
![Aid Response Figure](/assets/images/aid_afghanistan_fig.png)  
*2024 â€” Accepted, Food Security*  
This study examines the responsiveness of humanitarian aid to IPC Phase 4 transitions using geo-located aid flows and an event study framework. It finds that while aid follows food insecurity escalations, the response often falls short of covering affected populations.

### **Global Assessment of Acutely Hungry Misses One in Four**  
![Global IPC Error Figure](/assets/images/global_ipc_gap.png)  
*2024 â€” Under Review*  
This paper evaluates global IPC data coverage and reveals systematic gaps in identifying acutely food-insecure populations. Using merged datasets from IPC and WFP, the analysis shows underreporting is linked to data scarcity and operational constraints.

### **When Is a Crisis a Crisis? Assessing Internal Consistency in IPC Classifications**  
![Crisis Threshold Consistency](/assets/images/ipc_consistency.png)  
*2023 â€” R&R at World Development*  
Co-authored with E. Lentz, H. Michelson, and K. Baylis, this study assesses threshold consistency in IPC Acute Food Insecurity classifications using multivariate classification analysis.

## ðŸ”¬ Ongoing Work

### **A Data-Driven Approach for Early Detection of Food Insecurity in Yemen**  
![Yemen Early Warning Map](/assets/images/yemen_model_map.png)  
*Expected 2025*  
In collaboration with IPC ATARI, this project builds a machine learning-based risk monitoring system using indicators such as conflict, food prices, and agricultural productivity to issue subnational early warnings for Yemen.

### **Assets, Shocks, and Food Security Dynamics: Evidence from LSMS Surveys in Africa**  
![LSMS Shock Effects](/assets/images/lsms_assets_fs.png)  
*Expected 2025*  
Using panel data from Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Malawi, this study investigates how different types of household assets mediate the effects of conflict, price volatility, and climate shocks on food security outcomes.

### **Improving the Predictive Accuracy of IPC-Compatible Models**  
![IPC Model Calibration](/assets/images/ipc_model_accuracy.png)  
*In Progress*  
This project evaluates the reliability and operational readiness of machine learning models used in IPC projections. It proposes a case-by-case framework to test performance, granularity, and convergence with observational data.
