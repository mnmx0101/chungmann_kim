üåç I am a Ph.D. Candidate in applied economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, specializing in food security and nutrition in low- and middle-income countries. My research tackles one of the world‚Äôs most pressing challenges: ensuring vulnerable populations have reliable access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food. Specifically, my work centers on three key research agendas:

1. **Examining Economic and Environmental Drivers**  
   I study how economic conditions, environmental factors, and agricultural practices influence food insecurity and nutritional outcomes.

2. **Advancing Food Security Measurement**  
   I also contribute to better characterizing food-insecure populations and regions, as well as developing predictive tools using machine learning models to effectively target these populations and support early warning systems.

3. **Understanding Humanitarian Responses to Acute Hunger**  
   I investigate global humanitarian responses to acute hunger, assessing the effectiveness of aid mechanisms in addressing urgent food crises.

Leveraging causal inference, machine learning, and big data analytics, I work with diverse data sources‚Äîincluding household surveys, remote sensing products, and unstructured text data‚Äîto uncover the causes and consequences of food insecurity. My findings aim to inform targeted interventions and strategic policymaking.

## Professional Engagements

Beyond academia, I currently contribute as a consultant to two international institutions:

- **Data Scientist and Modeling Specialist** with the **[Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)](https://www.ipcinfo.org/)** Unit at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), focusing on developing advanced tools and models to strengthen food security early warning systems.  
- **Impact Assessment Specialist** with the **[International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)](http://ifad.org/en)**, providing expertise to support impact assessment initiatives.
