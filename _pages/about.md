🌍 I am a Ph.D. Candidate in applied economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, specializing in food security and nutrition in low- and middle-income countries. My research addresses one of the world’s most urgent challenges: ensuring vulnerable populations have access to adequate, safe, and nutritious food.

## Research Focus

My work is driven by three key research agendas:

1. **Examining Economic and Environmental Drivers**  
   I study how economic conditions, environmental factors, and agricultural practices influence food insecurity and nutritional outcomes.

2. **Advancing Food Security Measurement**  
   I also contribute to better characterizing food-insecure populations and regions, as well as developing predictive tools using machine learning models to effectively target these populations and support early warning systems.

3. **Understanding Humanitarian Responses to Acute Hunger**  
   I investigate global humanitarian responses to acute hunger, assessing the effectiveness of aid mechanisms in addressing urgent food crises.

Leveraging causal inference, machine learning, and big data analytics, I work with diverse data sources—including household surveys, remote sensing products, and unstructured text data—to uncover the causes and consequences of food insecurity. My findings aim to inform targeted interventions and strategic policymaking. 📊🌾

## Professional Engagements

Beyond academia, I currently contribute as a consultant to two international institutions:

- **Data Scientist and Modeling Specialist** at the **[Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)](https://www.ipcinfo.org/)** Unit of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), where I develop tools and models to enhance food security early warning systems.
- **Impact Assessment Specialist** at the **[International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)](http://ifad.org/en)**, providing evidence-based insights to strengthen global food security initiatives.
