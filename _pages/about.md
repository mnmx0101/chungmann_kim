**Hi üåç, thanks for visiting my website!**  
I'm an applied development economist and data scientist with a research focus on **food and environmental systems, global food security, humanitarian response, and development challenges in low- and middle-income countrie**s. My research integrates diverse data sources‚Äîincluding household surveys, satellite imagery, and unstructured text‚Äîand applies methods such as **natural language processing, causal inference, and machine learning** to construct novel datasets, analyze the dynamics of food insecurity, anticipate emerging risks, and evaluate the effectiveness of policy and humanitarian interventions.

## Research Interests:

My research focuses on understanding the **drivers of food security and nutrition**, specifically how agricultural systems, environmental conditions, governance structures, and market dynamics influence food access and nutritional outcomes. I also examine patterns in **humanitarian aid and donor behavior**, analyzing how aid is allocated and how effectively it responds to shocks caused by conflict, climate change, or economic disruptions. In addition, I am interested in advancing **AI for early warning and early action**, particularly by designing and evaluating AI-based tools that enhance the targeting and timeliness of humanitarian interventions.

## Professional Engagements

Beyond academic research, I have worked with several international organizations on both operational and research projects, including the **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)**, the **International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)**, and the **International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)**. These involve leading technical reports, conducting impact assessments, integrating diverse data sources, and developing predictive models to support real-time food security monitoring and early warning systems. I‚Äôve worked closely with interdisciplinary teams to ensure that analytical outputs are aligned with institutional priorities and inform decision-making in complex environments.

Currently, I work as a **Data Scientist and Modeling Specialist (Part-Time Consultant)** with the **[Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)](https://www.ipcinfo.org/)** initiative at FAO. I contribute to the development of a real-time risk monitoring system aimed at improving the early detection of food crises and enabling more timely humanitarian responses. My work involves: 1) developing an evaluation framework to assess the reliability and operational readiness of AI and statistical models; 2) applying data-driven methods to detect and prioritize relevant risk indicators for food crisis alerts; and 3) building a pipeline that scrapes, geo-tags, and applies topic modeling to news articles to generate real-time contextual insights.

My field experience as a community development practitioner has been a vital complement to my academic training. Before starting my doctoral studies, I worked for three years on an agricultural development project in Tanzania, where I led fieldwork and provided technical support. Working with a Korean NGO, I helped secure funding, conducted field-based research, and worked closely with smallholder farmers to assess needs and implement climate-resilient interventions.
