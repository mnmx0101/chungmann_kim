üåç Hi, I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Applied Economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. <br>  
I am an applied economist and data scientist focusing on global food security and agricultural development in low- and middle-income countries. I work with a wide range of data sources‚Äîincluding household surveys, satellite imagery, and unstructured text‚Äîand apply methods such as natural language processing, causal inference, and machine learning to construct novel datasets, investigate the drivers of food insecurity, and assess the impacts of related policies.

My doctoral research focuses on three key areas:  
1. **Agricultural Systems and Nutrition** ‚Äì Examining how agricultural production and market dynamics shape nutrition outcomes.  
2. **Predictive Modeling for Early Warning** ‚Äì Using machine learning to improve early warning systems and targeting for food security interventions.  
3. **Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response** ‚Äì Analyzing how humanitarian assistance is allocated in response to economic shocks and food insecurity.

## Professional Engagements

Beyond academia, I have worked with several international organizations, including the **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)**, the **International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)**, the **International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)**, and the **European Commission‚Äôs Joint Research Centre (EC-JRC)**. These have involved leading policy reports, conducting impact assessments, integrating diverse data sources, and developing predictive models to support real-time food security monitoring and early warning systems. I have worked closely with interdisciplinary teams across these institutions to ensure that technical outputs align with operational needs and policy priorities.

Currently, I serve as a **Data Scientist and Modeling Specialist** with the **[Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)](https://www.ipcinfo.org/)** unit at FAO. In this role, I contribute to the development of a real-time risk monitoring system designed to enhance early detection of food crises and support timely humanitarian response. This work plays a critical role in strengthening the global food security architecture in fragile and crisis-affected settings.

Equally important is my field experience as a community development practitioner. Before beginning my doctoral studies, I spent three years in Tanzania leading agricultural development initiatives with a Korean NGO. During this time, I secured grants, carried out field-based research, and worked closely with smallholder farmers to identify needs and implement climate-resilient solutions. These experiences gave me a grounded understanding of grassroots development and reinforced my commitment to inclusive, locally informed approaches that actively engage community stakeholders.
