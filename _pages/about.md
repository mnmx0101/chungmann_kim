**Hi — I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Economics at the University of Illinois Urbana‑Champaign.**  
As an applied economist and data scientist, I work at the nexus of food systems, crisis response, and predictive analytics in low‑ and middle‑income countries. Drawing on household surveys, satellite imagery, and unstructured text, I apply natural‑language processing, causal‑inference techniques, and machine‑learning models to build novel datasets, uncover the drivers of food insecurity, and assess policy impacts.

### Research Focus

- **Agricultural Systems & Nutrition** — Studying how agricultural production, environmental change, political instability, and market dynamics affect food security and nutritional outcomes.  
- **Predictive Analytics for Early Warning** — Leveraging machine learning models to improve the timeliness and accuracy of food crisis early warning systems and to inform targeted interventions.  
- **Humanitarian Aid & Crisis Response** — Analyzing the allocation and responsiveness of humanitarian assistance in the face of economic, environmental, and conflict-related shocks.    

## Professional Engagements

Beyond academia, I have worked with several international organizations, including the **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)**, the **International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)**, and the **International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)**. These have involved leading technical report, conducting impact assessments, integrating diverse data sources, and developing predictive models to support real-time food security monitoring and early warning systems. I have worked closely with interdisciplinary teams across these institutions to ensure that technical outputs align with operational needs and policy priorities.

Currently, I work as a **Data Scientist and Modeling Specialist** with the **[Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)](https://www.ipcinfo.org/)** unit at FAO. In this role, I contribute to the development of a real-time risk monitoring system designed to enhance early detection of food crises and support timely humanitarian response.

My field experience as a community development practitioner has been a vital complement to my academic training. Before beginning my doctoral studies, I was actively involved in an agricultural development project in Tanzania, where I led fieldwork and provided technical support for three years. Working with a Korean NGO, I helped secure funding, conducted field-based research, and closely worked with smallholder farmers to assess needs and implement climate-resilient interventions.
