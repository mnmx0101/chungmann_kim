🌍 I am an applied economist dedicated to advancing food security and nutrition in low-income countries. My research addresses one of the world’s most pressing challenges: ensuring food security and improved nutritional outcomes in low- and middle-income regions. My work focuses on three primary agendas: (1) examining how economic and environmental conditions, along with agricultural practices, impact food insecurity and nutritional outcomes; (2) advancing the measurement and assessment of food security; and (3) analyzing global humanitarian responses to acute hunger. Leveraging causal inference and big data analytics, I actively work with a range of data sources—including survey data, remote sensing products, and unstructured text—to investigate the causes and consequences of food insecurity. 📊🌾

In addition to my academic work, I serve as a **Data Scientist and Modeling Specialist** with the **[Integrated Food Security Phase Classification](https://www.ipcinfo.org/) Unit of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)** and as an **Impact Assessment Specialist** at **[IFAD](http://ifad.org/en)**, helping provide policy-makers with actionable insights to address global food security challenges.

I aim to bridge data-driven insights with actionable policy solutions to build resilience and improve health outcomes for vulnerable communities. 🌟
