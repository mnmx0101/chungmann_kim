**Hi üåç, thanks for visiting my website!**  
I'm an applied development economist and data scientist with a focus on food and environmental systems, global food security, humanitarian response, and development challenges in low- and middle-income countries. My research integrates diverse data sources‚Äîincluding household surveys, satellite imagery, and unstructured text‚Äîand applies methods such as natural language processing, causal inference, and machine learning to construct novel datasets, analyze the dynamics of food insecurity, anticipate emerging risks, and evaluate the effectiveness of policy and humanitarian interventions.

### Current Research Interests

- **Drivers of Global Food Security:** Exploring how agricultural production, environmental change, political instability, and market dynamics influence food security and nutrition outcomes.
- **Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response:** Analyzing how humanitarian assistance is allocated and how effectively it responds to economic, environmental, and conflict-related shocks.
- **Predictive Analytics for Early Warning:** Developing tools to improve the accuracy and timeliness of food crisis early warning systems and guide targeted interventions.

## Professional Engagements

Beyond academic research, I have worked with several international organizations on both operational and research projects, including the **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)**, the **International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)**, and the **International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)**. These involve leading technical reports, conducting impact assessments, integrating diverse data sources, and developing predictive models to support real-time food security monitoring and early warning systems. I‚Äôve worked closely with interdisciplinary teams to ensure that analytical outputs are aligned with institutional priorities and inform decision-making in complex environments.

Currently, I work as a **Data Scientist and Modeling Specialist** with the **[Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)](https://www.ipcinfo.org/)** initiative at FAO. In this role, I contribute to the development of a real-time risk monitoring system designed to enhance early detection of food crises and enable more timely humanitarian responses. My work includes 1) developing an evaluation framework to assess the reliability and operational readiness of AI and statistical models, 2) applying data-driven methods to identify and mask relevant signals for food crisis alerts, and 3) building a pipeline that scrapes, geo-tags, and applies topic modeling to news articles for real-time contextual insights.

My field experience as a community development practitioner has been a vital complement to my academic training. Before starting my doctoral studies, I worked for three years on an agricultural development project in Tanzania, where I led fieldwork and provided technical support. Working with a Korean NGO, I helped secure funding, conducted field-based research, and worked closely with smallholder farmers to assess needs and implement climate-resilient interventions.
