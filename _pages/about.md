üåç I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Applied Economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, specializing in food security and nutrition in low- and middle-income countries. My research addresses one of the world‚Äôs most critical challenges: ensuring that vulnerable populations have consistent access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food. Specifically, my work focuses on three key research areas:

1. **Drivers of Food Insecurity**  
   I study how economic conditions, environmental factors, and agricultural practices influence food insecurity and nutritional outcomes.

2. **Advancing Poverty/Food Security Measurement**  
   I also contribute to better characterizing food-insecure populations and regions, as well as developing predictive tools using machine learning models to effectively target these populations and support early warning systems.

3. **Humanitarian Aid Responses to Acute Hunger**  
   I investigate global humanitarian responses to acute hunger, assessing the effectiveness of aid mechanisms in addressing urgent food crises.

Leveraging causal inference, machine learning, and big data analytics, I work with diverse data sources‚Äîincluding household surveys, remote sensing products, and unstructured text data‚Äîto uncover the causes and consequences of poverty/food insecurity. My findings aim to inform targeted interventions and strategic policymaking.

## Professional Engagements

Beyond academia, I currently contribute as a consultant to international institutions:

- **Data Scientist and Modeling Specialist** with the **[Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)](https://www.ipcinfo.org/)** Unit at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), focusing on developing advanced tools and models to strengthen food security early warning systems.  
- **Impact Assessment Specialist** with the **[International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)](http://ifad.org/en)**, providing expertise to support impact assessment initiatives.
