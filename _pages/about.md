🌍 I am an applied development economist specializing in food security and nutrition in low-income countries. My research centers on three primary agendas: (1) examining how economic and environmental conditions, as well as agricultural practices, impact food insecurity and nutritional outcomes; (2) advancing the measurement and assessment of food security; and (3) analyzing global humanitarian responses to identified acute hunger. Leveraging causal inference and big data analytics, I work with diverse data sources—including survey data, remote sensing products, and unstructured text—to investigate the causes and consequences of food insecurity.📊🌾

Beyond academia, I contribute to critical initiatives as a **Data Scientist and Modeling Specialist** with the **[Integrated Food Security Phase Classification](https://www.ipcinfo.org/) Unit of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)** and as an **Impact Assessment Specialist** at **[IFAD](http://ifad.org/en)**, supporting policy-making and impact assessments for global food security.

I am committed to transforming data-driven insights into actionable policies that build resilience and improve health outcomes for vulnerable communities. 🌟
