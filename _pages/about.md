🌍 I am an **Applied Development Economist** dedicated to advancing food security and nutrition in low-income countries. My research focuses on three core areas: understanding how economic and environmental factors impact food insecurity, improving food security measurement, and analyzing global humanitarian responses to acute hunger. 📊🌾

In my academic work, I use tools like causal inference and machine learning to address food security challenges. By integrating diverse data sources, including household surveys, remote sensing, and unstructured text, I provide actionable insights that guide policymakers. 🌐🤖

Beyond academia, I contribute to critical initiatives as a **Data Scientist and Modeling Specialist** with the **[Integrated Food Security Phase Classification](https://www.ipcinfo.org/) Unit of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)** and as an **Impact Assessment Specialist** at **[IFAD](http://ifad.org/)**, supporting policy-making and impact assessments for global food security.

In my job market paper, I explore the responsiveness of humanitarian aid to food crises in Afghanistan, using a text-finding algorithm, NLP, and geo-coding to identify gaps in aid effectiveness. This research extends to other high-vulnerability regions, including Ethiopia, Lebanon, South Sudan, Somalia, and the DRC, offering insights into aid allocation across diverse geopolitical contexts. In a related study, I apply a non-parametric statistical method, the bunching estimator, to reveal the underestimation of acute hunger worldwide and advocate for more accurate food security classifications. 🚨📉

Through multi-measure studies on food security indicators and predictive modeling, I am developing robust, transparent tools to improve global food security responses. My research on early-life food prices and agricultural systems highlights the complex drivers of nutrition and dietary outcomes. 📈🥛

I am committed to transforming data-driven insights into actionable policies that build resilience and improve health outcomes for vulnerable communities. 🌟
