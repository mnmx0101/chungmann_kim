Machine learning (ML) holds potential to predict hunger crises before they occur. Yet, ML models embed crucial choices that affect their utility. We develop a prototype model to predict food insecurity across three countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Readily available data on prices, assets, and weather all influence our model predictions. Our model obtains 55%â€“84% accuracy, substantially outperforming both a logit and ML models using only time and location. We highlight key principles for transparency and demonstrate how modeling choices between recall and accuracy can be tailored to policy-maker needs. Our work provides a path for future modeling efforts in this area.

The government of Viet Nam promotes an integrated and diversified production system that focuses on the symbiotic relationship of livestock, aquaculture, and fruits and vegetables (F&V), locally known as Vuon Ao Chuong (VAC). The expectation is that this system can prevent soil degradation, while improving dietary quality and income. This study examines the correlation between VAC production systems and diets using cross-sectional data from the 2016 round of the Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS). Using ordinary least squares, we model four continuous outcome variables related to quantity consumed of fruits and vegetables, fiber, animal protein, and dietary energy; while using logistical regression, we model three indicator variables related to whether diets are balanced in terms of intake of dietary energy derived from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. While individual components of VAC, such as aquaculture or F&V production, show a positive correlation with one or more dietary indicators, adoption of the full VAC system is found to be positively correlated only with dietary fiber consumption, making it challenging to establish a causal link between system adoption and improved dietary quality. However, we find that several socioeconomic variables, such as access to markets, household wealth, education of the household members, and household size are positively associated with one or more dietary indicators. Further research is needed to establish strong and causal relationships, or lack thereof, between VAC system and diets by exploiting the panel structure of VHLSS to examine the role of VAC in improving nutritional outcomes in Viet Nam.

The ability for women to operate as food entrepreneurs presents opportunities to leverage at-home production technologies that not only support family nutrition but also generate income. To these ends, the Feed the Future Malawi Agriculture Diversification Activity recently launched a development project involving a new technology, the Soy Kit. The Activity, a USAID (United States Agency for International Development) funded effort, sought to improve nutrition utilizing an underutilized local and highly nutritious feedstuff, soybean, through a womanâ€™s entrepreneurship scheme.

### **From Food Crisis to Resource Allocation: Tracking Humanitarian Aid in Afghanistan**  
![Aid Flow Analysis](../images/aid_main_fig (1).png)  
*2025 â€” Job Market Paper*  
[*Link to draft:*](https://uofi.app.box.com/file/1716072760356?s=q0oxfiytwzgzziogdyc60mmc7p40co5t)  
*Abstract:* This study sheds light on a critical challenge for global humanitarian efforts: delivering timely, targeted aid to regions facing acute food insecurity. As hunger intensifies worldwide, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system plays a pivotal role, alerting the world to regions in crisis and directing billions in relief aid to those in dire need. Yet, a fundamental question remainsâ€”does the IPC mobilize aid with the speed and precision necessary to meet escalating needs? Focusing on Afghanistan, a priority IPC country, this study introduces a novel dataset that aligns humanitarian funding flows with IPC regional classifications. Utilizing a staggered Difference-in-Differences approach, I investigate how IPC phase escalations impact immediate aid responses. The findings reveal a significant but insufficient increase in funding following transitions to IPC Phase 4, underscoring the gap between current aid allocations and the critical needs of populations facing severe food insecurity. This research offers a first-of-its-kind subnational analysis of IPC-driven aid allocation, providing policymakers with essential insights to strengthen future humanitarian response efforts.

### **Hidden Hunger: Global Population of Acutely Hungry is Underestimated by Â¼**

*2025 â€” Revise & Resubmit, Nature Food*  
[*Link to draft:*](https://uofi.app.box.com/file/1688331946836?s=v2tylljea7plookmep4im18tm4c77clh) 
[*Replication Code:*](https://github.com/mnmx0101/IPC_Paper) 
*Abstract:* Acute hunger affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide with long-term consequences for health, development and security. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system is the global method for classifying food insecurity severity and is used to allocate more than six billion dollars of humanitarian food assistance annually. Despite concerns that IPC estimates overstate globally food insecurity, our analysis of data from 2.8 billion people between 2017-2023 shows the opposite. We find that IPC assessments underestimate the number of acutely hungry people in the world, missing one in four. Using a non-parametric statistical approach, we find evidence of bunching or under-classification around the threshold that differentiates areas classified as â€˜stressedâ€™ from those â€˜in crisisâ€™â€”a critical threshold intended to trigger humanitarian funding. Contrary to widely held assumptions, our findings suggest that the prevalence and severity of acute hunger is significantly higher than current global estimates.

### **Early-Year Milk Prices and Child Stunting in Zambia**

*Abstract:* Zambia experienced a sharp rise in food prices in late 2015. In this study, we construct a novel dataset by integrating historical food price data with the most recent Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) from 2018. We examine the relationship between early-life food prices (e.g., fresh milk and mealie meal) and under-five child stunting in Zambia, while accounting for child-level characteristics and household fixed effects. Our findings suggest that elevated milk prices during the early years of life (12 to 24 months) are a significant risk factor for stunting among children aged 24 to 59 months, particularly those who completed their first two years of life. The effect is especially pronounced in urban areas, particularly among the poorest and middle-income groups, whose milk consumption rates are relatively high, excluding the wealthiest group. This study contributes to the literature by empirically identifying the critical timing at which price shocks in nutrient-dense foods contribute to stunting. It highlights both the most vulnerable groups during price shocks and the optimal timing for interventions to mitigate the risk of stunting.
